# Concepts

* **arm**: an arm consists of a pattern and the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the `match` expression fits that armâ€™s pattern.
* **associated function**: static function
* **crate**: library
* **enum**


# Rules

* Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
* Variables are immutable by default.
* Use `mut` before the variable name to make a variable mutable.


# Useful Commands

* Create project: `cargo new <project_name>`
* Build project: `cargo build [--release]`
* Build and run project: `cargo run`
* Check if project compiles:`cargo check`
* Update Crate: `cargo update`
